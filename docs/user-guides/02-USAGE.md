     - Fastest processing
     - Best general-purpose quality

   - **htdemucs_6s** (6-stem) - For instrumental-heavy music
     - Stems: vocals, drums, bass, other, guitar, piano
     - Slower processing (~1.5x longer)
     - Better separation of specific instruments

3. **Select Stems**:
   - ✅ Check stems you want to extract
   - Fewer stems = faster processing
   - Typical: Extract all stems for full control

4. **Click "Extract"**:
   - Processing begins immediately
   - Real-time progress updates via WebSocket
   - Do not close browser during extraction

### Extraction Process

**Processing Time**:
- **CPU Mode**: 3-8 minutes per 4-minute song (htdemucs)
- **GPU Mode**: 20-60 seconds per 4-minute song (4-8x faster)

**Progress Updates**:
```
Extracting... 0% - Initializing Demucs
Extracting... 25% - Separating stems
Extracting... 50% - Processing vocals
Extracting... 75% - Processing drums
Extracting... 100% - Finalizing
✓ Extraction complete!
```

**Results**:
- Individual stem files saved in `downloads/global/VIDEO_ID/stems/htdemucs/`
- Mixer automatically available
- Chords, structure, lyrics analyzed (if selected)

### Advanced Options

**Stem Selection**:
- Extract only specific stems to save time
- Example: Vocals-only for karaoke practice

## Pitch & Tempo Control

**Real-time pitch and tempo adjustment** using SoundTouch + Web Audio API.

**⚠️ HTTPS REQUIREMENT**: Pitch/tempo control requires HTTPS or localhost due to SharedArrayBuffer restrictions.

### Enabling HTTPS

**Option 1: Use ngrok** (Recommended):
```bash
./start_service.sh
```

Access via ngrok URL: `https://your-subdomain.ngrok-free.app`

**Option 2: Local Access**:
Access via `http://localhost:5011` (HTTPS not required for localhost)

**Option 3: Custom SSL Certificate**:
See [HTTPS Setup Guide](../admin-guides/HTTPS-SETUP.md)

### Pitch Control

**Pitch Shift Range**: -12 to +12 semitones

**Common Uses**:
- **Transpose to your vocal range**: Shift up/down to comfortable key
- **Instrument tuning**: Match alternate tunings
- **Creative effects**: Chipmunk (+12) or deep (-12) effects

**How to Use**:
1. Open mixer
2. Find "Pitch" control (global controls section)
3. Drag slider or enter value (-12 to +12)
4. Pitch changes applied in real-time

**Examples**:
- Original key: C major
- +2 semitones: D major
- -3 semitones: A major
- +12 semitones: C major (one octave higher)

**Quality**:
- Minimal artifacts for ±5 semitones
- Noticeable quality loss beyond ±7 semitones
- Uses time-domain WSOLA algorithm (SoundTouch)

### Tempo Control

**Tempo Range**: 0.5x to 2.0x (50% to 200%)

**Common Uses**:
- **Practice slow**: 0.7x-0.9x for learning difficult passages
- **Speed up**: 1.1x-1.3x for faster listening
- **Half/double time**: 0.5x or 2.0x for rhythm experiments

**How to Use**:
1. Open mixer
2. Find "Tempo" control (global controls section)
3. Drag slider or enter value (0.5 to 2.0)
4. Tempo changes applied in real-time

**Examples**:
- 1.0x: Original tempo (120 BPM → 120 BPM)
- 0.8x: 20% slower (120 BPM → 96 BPM)
- 1.25x: 25% faster (120 BPM → 150 BPM)
- 0.5x: Half speed (120 BPM → 60 BPM)

**Quality**:
- Excellent quality 0.7x-1.3x
- Good quality 0.5x-0.7x and 1.3x-1.5x
- Noticeable artifacts beyond 1.5x or below 0.5x

### Independent Pitch & Tempo

**Pitch without tempo change**:
- Change pitch slider only
- Tempo remains at 1.0x
- Example: Transpose up 3 semitones at original speed

**Tempo without pitch change**:
- Change tempo slider only
- Pitch remains at 0 semitones
- Example: Slow to 0.8x without changing key

**Combined**:
- Adjust both independently
- Example: +2 semitones, 0.9x tempo
- No crosstalk between pitch and tempo

### Hybrid Engine

StemTube uses a **hybrid pitch/tempo engine**:
- **SoundTouch**: Offline time-stretch (AudioWorklet)
- **playbackRate**: Real-time fine-tuning (Web Audio API)
- **Combination**: Best quality with zero latency

**Troubleshooting**:
- "Pitch/tempo not working": Check HTTPS enabled or using localhost
- Browser compatibility: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+
- Artifacts/glitches: Extreme pitch/tempo values (reduce range)
- Latency: Should be zero - reload mixer if experiencing delays
