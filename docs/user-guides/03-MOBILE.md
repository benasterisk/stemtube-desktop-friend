## Quick Start

### Accessing Mobile Interface

**HTTPS Required**: Mobile features require HTTPS due to browser security policies.

**Step 1: Start with HTTPS**
```bash
cd StemTube_R2
./start_service.sh
```

**Step 2: Get ngrok URL**
Look for output in terminal:
```
ngrok tunnel active:
https://abc123.ngrok-free.app
```

**Step 3: Access on Mobile**
- Open browser on mobile device
- Navigate to: `https://your-subdomain.ngrok-free.app/mobile`
- Bookmark for easy access

**Supported Browsers**:
- **iOS**: Safari 14+, Chrome 90+
- **Android**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Samsung Internet

---

## Installing as PWA

StemTube can be installed as a Progressive Web App (PWA) for a native app-like experience.

### iOS Installation

1. Open the mobile interface in **Safari** (required for iOS PWA)
2. Navigate to: `https://your-subdomain.ngrok-free.app/mobile`
3. Tap the **Share** button (square with arrow)
4. Scroll down and tap **"Add to Home Screen"**
5. Name the app and tap **Add**
6. Launch StemTube from your home screen

### Android Installation

1. Open the mobile interface in **Chrome**
2. Navigate to: `https://your-subdomain.ngrok-free.app/mobile`
3. Look for the **"Install App"** button at the bottom of the screen
4. Tap **Install** in the prompt
5. Launch StemTube from your home screen or app drawer

**Alternative Method (Android)**:
- Tap the three-dot menu in Chrome
- Select **"Add to Home screen"** or **"Install app"**

### PWA Benefits

- **Standalone Mode**: No browser URL bar, full-screen experience
- **Home Screen Icon**: Launch like a native app
- **Offline Support**: Access cached audio without internet
- **Faster Loading**: Core files cached locally
- **Splash Screen**: Branded loading screen on startup

---

## Offline Mode

StemTube supports offline playback of previously cached audio.

### How Offline Mode Works

1. **Automatic Caching**: When you play a track, audio files are automatically cached
2. **Manual Caching**: Use the Settings tab to explicitly cache tracks
3. **Offline Playback**: Cached tracks are available without internet connection
4. **Offline Banner**: A "You are offline" banner appears when disconnected

### Mobile Settings Tab

Access the **Settings** tab in the mobile interface to manage offline audio:

**Cache Management**:
- **View Cache Size**: See total storage used by cached audio
- **Clear Audio Cache**: Remove all cached audio to free storage
- **Cache Specific Tracks**: Manually cache tracks for offline use

**Settings Options**:
- **Auto-cache**: Toggle automatic caching of played tracks
- **Cache Quality**: Choose between standard and high quality caching
- **Storage Limit**: Set maximum cache size

### Caching Audio for Offline

**Automatic** (Default):
- Audio is cached as you listen
- Recent tracks available offline

**Manual**:
1. Open the track in the mixer
2. Go to **Settings** tab
3. Tap **"Cache for Offline"**
4. Track is now available offline

### Storage Considerations

- **Stems**: Each extracted song uses 20-50 MB
- **Recommended**: Keep 500 MB - 1 GB free for caching
- **Clear Cache**: Use Settings tab when storage is low

## iOS Specific

### iOS Audio Unlock

**iOS Restriction**: Safari requires user interaction before audio playback.

**StemTube Solution**: Automatic unlock mechanism

**How It Works**:
1. First time visiting page: "Tap to enable audio" button appears
2. Tap button: iOS audio unlocked
3. Subsequent visits: Audio works automatically
4. Unlock state preserved in session

**Manual Unlock** (if automatic fails):
1. Tap anywhere on page
2. Click play button
3. iOS audio should unlock

**Troubleshooting iOS Audio**:
- **No sound**: Ensure ringer/silent switch is OFF (not in silent mode)
- **First play fails**: Tap screen, then play again
- **Audio cuts out**: Avoid locking screen during playback
- **Background playback**: Not supported (browser limitation)

### iOS Safari Quirks

**Playback Controls**:
- Use native iOS audio controls (appears in Control Center)
- Lock screen controls available
- AirPlay supported

**PWA Support** (Add to Home Screen):
1. Open mobile interface in Safari
2. Tap Share button
3. Select "Add to Home Screen"
4. Launch as standalone app

**iOS Versions**:
- iOS 14+: Full support
- iOS 13: Partial support (some Web Audio API limitations)
- iOS 12 and below: Not supported

### iOS Performance

**Recommended Settings**:
- Close background apps
- Ensure sufficient storage (2+ GB free)
- Use WiFi for downloads (not cellular)
- Disable Low Power Mode during playback

**Battery Life**:
- Stem extraction: Heavy battery usage (plug in recommended)
- Mixer playback: Moderate usage (2-3 hours typical)
- Background: Minimal usage

### Android Performance

**Chrome Recommended**: Best performance and compatibility

**Performance Tips**:
- Close background apps
- Use "Lite" mode in Chrome for slower devices
